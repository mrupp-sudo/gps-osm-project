# Driving Simulation with OpenStreetMap

Autonomous driving (AD) has the potential to revolutionize transportation by enhancing road safety, reducing human error, and improving efficiency. To explore the application of semantic technologies in AD, this project presents a system for simulating vehicle behavior by integrating [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) (OSM) and weather data into a dynamic knowledge representation using Datalog. The system generates Global Positioning System (GPS)-based data streams and retrieves spatial and environmental information, converting it into structured facts using Prolog syntax. Criticality and reachability of driving situations are analyzed through a rule-based framework, taking into account factors such as road features, traffic objects, and weather conditions, which can be used to test different reasoners. While a general-purpose, rule-based reasoning engine from [Apache Jena](https://jena.apache.org/) is integrated as an example, the data stream can be accessed through a Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) socket connection with any custom reasoner.
